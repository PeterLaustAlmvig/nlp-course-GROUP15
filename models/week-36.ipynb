       "'Religious debates over the \"Harry Potter\" series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series have said that the magic in \"Harry Potter\" bears little resemblance to occultism, being more in the vein of fairy tales such as \"Cinderella\" and \"Snow White\", or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue, the \"Harry Potter\" novels go out of their way to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\".'"
